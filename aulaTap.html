<p style="font-size:1,3cm;">The Rick Roll is a phenomenon that originated on the internet in 2007. It involves tricking someone into clicking on a hyperlink that leads them to the music video for the 1987 song "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Never Gonna Give You Up</a>" by Rick Astley. The video features Astley singing and dancing to the song while dressed in 1980s fashion.

The practice of Rick Rolling began on the 4chan internet forum, where users would post a hyperlink and label it as something intriguing, such as a leaked video game or celebrity scandal. When clicked, the link would take the user to the "Never Gonna Give You Up" music video instead. The term "Rick Rolling" comes from Rick Astley's name and the idea of rolling someone, or tricking them.

The phenomenon quickly spread beyond 4chan, with Rick Rolling becoming a popular prank on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. The unexpected nature of the prank, coupled with the catchy nature of the song and Astley's distinctive voice and dance moves, made it a hit among internet users.

The Rick Roll has also been used for various public events and political campaigns. In 2008, the New York Mets baseball team played "Never Gonna Give You Up" during a game as part of a promotion. In the same year, the song was used by the campaign team of U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama, who Rick Rolled supporters with a video message from Astley.

In recent years, Rick Rolling has become less prevalent as internet users have grown accustomed to the prank. However, the practice has had a lasting impact on internet culture, with the "Never Gonna Give You Up" music video remaining a popular meme and symbol of the early days of the internet.</p>
